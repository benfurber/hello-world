# hello-world
Me following the 'Hello World' Github guide.

Oh how despairingly sad of me. Here I am doing one of those procedural guides to get my head around a new tool and I feel the need to write an original ‘Hello World’ statement. Ah. Well. Done now. 

…Expect probably not. Someone else on Github must have made a similarly sad statement before…

…And maybe the last comment too…

…And, OK I’ll stop now.
